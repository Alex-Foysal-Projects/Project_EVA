  Subtle animations (fades, slides) for notifications and state changes that enhance user delight.
- **Accessibility:**  
  Adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA standards, ensuring the interface is navigable and inclusive across devices.

### **Key Screens & Flows**

1. **Home Dashboard:**  
   - A weekly snapshot showing all events (aggregated from multiple calendars) and Eva’s recommended time blocks.
   - A floating chat bubble for quick interactions.
2. **Onboarding Flow:**  
   - An animated welcome and setup process that gathers your priorities and integrates your calendars.
3. **Real-Time Interaction:**  
   - Dynamic nudges and pop-up cards that notify you of missed blocks or opportunities to complete micro-tasks.
4. **End-of-Week Reflection:**

### 5.2 Phase 1: Setup & Environment Configuration

**Objectives:**

- Initialize the repository, virtual environment, and folder structure.
- Install dependencies.
- Write a smoke test to verify module imports.

**Steps:**

1. **Initialize Repository:**  
   - Run `git init` and create a `.gitignore` file.
2. **Set Up Virtual Environment:**  
   - Create and activate a virtual environment.
   - Install packages via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Create Folder Structure:**  
   - Set up directories as shown above.
4. **Smoke Test:**  
   - File: `src/tests/test_setup.py`
   ```python
   def test_imports():
       from eva import main, calendar_integration, planning_engine, conversation, dashboard
       assert main is not None
   ```
5. **CI Setup (Optional):**  
   - Configure CI to run tests on commits.

---

### 5.3 Phase 2: Planning Engine

**Objectives:**

- Parse natural language input for priorities.
- Generate a weekly plan by reading aggregated calendar events.

**Steps:**

1. **Parsing Priorities:**  
   - Function: `parse_priorities(input_str: str) -> dict` in `src/eva/planning_engine.py`.
   - Test (in `src/tests/test_planning_engine.py`):
   ```python
   def test_parse_priorities():
       from eva.planning_engine import parse_priorities
       input_str = "I need 3 workouts, 2 deep work sessions, and 1 family dinner."
       priorities = parse_priorities(input_str)
       assert priorities["workouts"] == 3
       assert priorities["deep_work"] == 2
       assert priorities["family_dinner"] == 1
   ```
2. **Calendar Integration Stub:**  
   - Function: `get_week_events()` in `src/eva/calendar_integration.py` returns dummy events.
   - Corresponding tests in `src/tests/test_calendar_integration.py`.
3. **Plan Generation:**  
   - Function: `generate_weekly_plan(priorities: dict, events: list) -> dict` in `src/eva/planning_engine.py`.
   - Test example:
   ```python
   def test_generate_weekly_plan():
       from eva.planning_engine import generate_weekly_plan
       dummy_priorities = {"workouts": 3, "deep_work": 2, "family_dinner": 1}
       dummy_events = [{"start": "2023-01-01T09:00", "end": "2023-01-01T10:00"}]
       plan = generate_weekly_plan(dummy_priorities, dummy_events)
       assert "workouts" in plan
       # Additional assertions to check non-overlapping time blocks
   ```
4. **Utilities:**  
   - Add helper functions in `src/eva/utils.py`.

---

### 5.4 Phase 3: Conversation Layer

**Objectives:**

- Enable natural language dialogue for adjusting the plan.
- Integrate with GPT API (using mocks initially).

**Steps:**

1. **Conversation Function:**  
   - Function: `handle_conversation(input_str: str, current_plan: dict) -> dict` in `src/eva/conversation.py`.
   - Test (in `src/tests/test_conversation.py`):
   ```python
   def test_handle_conversation_update():
       from eva.conversation import handle_conversation
       current_plan = {"deep_work": {"time": "09:00-10:30"}}
       input_str = "I want to push my deep work session to later."
       updated_plan = handle_conversation(input_str, current_plan)
       assert updated_plan["deep_work"]["time"] != "09:00-10:30"
   ```
2. **GPT API Helper:**  
   - In `src/eva/utils.py`, create `query_gpt(prompt: str) -> str`.
   - Use mocks in tests to simulate API responses.
3. **Interactive Flow:**  
   - In `src/eva/main.py`, implement a simple loop or Streamlit interface for conversation.

---

### 5.5 Phase 4: Real-Time Dashboard

**Objectives:**

- Display planned versus actual events with real-time feedback.
- Provide nudges and visual insights.

**Steps:**

1. **Data Comparison:**  
   - Function: `compare_plan_actual(plan: dict, actual_events: list) -> dict` in `src/eva/dashboard.py`.
   - Test (in `src/tests/test_dashboard.py`):
   ```python
   def test_compare_plan_actual():
       from eva.dashboard import compare_plan_actual
       plan = {"deep_work": {"time": "09:00-10:30", "status": "planned"}}
       actual = [{"summary": "Meeting", "start": "2023-01-01T09:00", "end": "2023-01-01T09:45"}]
       report = compare_plan_actual(plan, actual)
       assert "deep_work" in report
       # Validate deviation reporting
   ```
2. **Dashboard UI:**  
   - Build a Streamlit interface in `src/eva/dashboard.py` (or separate file) to display the unified view.
3. **Nudging System:**  
   - Develop functions to trigger context-aware nudges.
   - Write tests to simulate deviations and responses.

---

### 5.6 Testing Strategy & Coverage

**Objectives:**

- Achieve near-100% unit test coverage for core functions.
- Supplement with integration, end-to-end (E2E), user acceptance, performance, and security tests.

**Testing Breakdown:**

1. **Unit Tests:**  
   - Each module (calendar integration, planning engine, conversation, dashboard) has dedicated unit tests.
2. **Integration Tests:**  
   - File: `src/tests/test_integration.py` to ensure modules interact correctly.
3. **End-to-End Tests:**  
   - File: `src/tests/test_e2e.py` simulating a full user flow from input to dashboard.
4. **User Acceptance Tests (UAT):**  
   - File: `src/tests/test_user_acceptance.py` or use tools like Selenium to simulate real interactions.
5. **Performance Tests:**  
   - File: `src/tests/test_performance.py` to benchmark key functions.
6. **Security Tests:**  
   - File: `src/tests/test_security.py` to validate secure handling of external integrations.

**Running Tests:**
```bash
pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q
```

This comprehensive strategy ensures that while we target near-100% unit test coverage, integration, E2E, UAT, performance, and security tests will further guarantee that Eva meets production standards and delivers a delightful user experience.

## 6. Calendar Integration Overview

Eva’s power comes from its seamless integration with all your calendars:

- **Initial Setup:**  
  - During onboarding, you connect your various calendars (Google, Outlook, etc.) via secure OAuth.
- **Unified Timeline:**  
  - Eva aggregates events from all sources into one coherent timeline, resolving overlaps and conflicts.
- **Plan Generation:**  
  - When generating your weekly plan, Eva accounts for all pre-existing events, identifying gaps and protected slots.
- **Real-Time Sync:**  
  - Throughout the day, Eva continuously updates the unified view with any changes (new events, cancellations, modifications).
- **Feedback & Reflection:**  
  - At week’s end, Eva compares the aggregated “actual” events against the planned schedule and provides insights for improvement.

This integration is at the core of Eva’s ability to offer intelligent, context-aware planning and nudges.
